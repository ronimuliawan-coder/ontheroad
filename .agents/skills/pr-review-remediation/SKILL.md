description: "End-to-end pull request review remediation workflow for code repositories. Gathers reviewer findings (CodeRabbit, Macroscope, Greptile), waits for reviewers to settle, batches fixes into a single atomic commit, tests locally, replies with informal sign-off attribution ('- AG-Ron'), and monitors CI until 100% green. Use when asked to 'check open PR comments', 'resolve PR reviews', 'triage PR reviews', or when running /resolve-pr-reviews."

# PR Review Remediation Workflow

A resource-efficient workflow for evaluating, fixing, replying to, and remediating automated code reviewer comments (CodeRabbit, Macroscope, Greptile, etc.) on GitHub Pull Requests. This workflow does not grant authority to commit, push, post, resolve threads, merge, deploy, or change credentials; each external write requires explicit user approval and the repository's declared authority.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Comprehensive 360-Degree Entry Point Audit**:
   When notified that new comments or reviews have been posted, the assistant MUST automatically inspect **every possible entry point** on the PR without requiring the user to specify links or perspectives:
   - **Inline Review Threads**: Both open threads and threads with new follow-up replies on recent or historical commits.
   - **Discussion Replies**: Responses to previous fixes, explanations, or earlier `- AG-Ron` comments.
   - **Top-Level PR Reviews (`pullrequestreview-*`)**: Formal review submissions, overall statuses, and embedded findings.
   - **Collapsible `<details>` & Nitpicks**: Expandable sections within bot review summaries or inline comments.
   - **General Issue Comments (`issuecomment-*`)**: Top-level PR timeline comments and bot summaries.
   - **Commit-Specific & Range Diffs**: Comments attached to single commits (`/changes/<sha>#r...`) or cumulative diffs (`/changes/BASE..<sha>#r...`).
   Every finding from any entry point must receive the same rigorous, critical evaluation against live code.

2. **Informal Attribution Sign-off on All Comments**:
   Every PR comment reply MUST end with the signature at the bottom:

   ```markdown
   <explanation of fix or technical rebuttal>

   - AG-Ron
   ```

3. **Single Local Commit per Batch Cycle; Explicit Push Approval**:
   Never commit or push incrementally for individual comments. Aggregate all accepted fixes across the entire batch (main comments, outside-diffs, nitpicks), run local verification across the combined diff, and create at most one local commit per review cycle. Pushing, posting replies, resolving threads, merging, and deployment require explicit user approval at the point of action.

4. **Explicit Reviewer Quiescence / Settle Window**:
   Before reading comments or formulating fixes, verify that all automated reviewer check-suites (`coderabbitai`, `MacroscopeApp`, `Greptile Apps`, `GitHub Actions`) on the latest commit have transitioned from `queued` / `in_progress` to `completed`. If any are still running, wait using a schedule timer (e.g. 45–60s) until they settle to ensure findings are reviewed in complete batches.

5. **Never Resolve Review Threads / Conversations Autonomously**:
   The assistant MUST NEVER resolve PR review threads or conversations. Only the reviewers (human or AI) or Ron can resolve conversations/threads. The assistant evaluates each comment, prepares code fixes for valid issues, or drafts attributed technical rebuttals (with code/architectural evidence) if a comment is invalid, a false positive, or out of scope, allowing the reviewer or Ron to evaluate and resolve the thread. Posting or pushing requires the explicit approval described above.

6. **Never Auto-Merge Promotion PRs**:
   Promotion PRs (`release/promote-dev-* -> main`) must NEVER be merged by the assistant. The assistant brings the PR to 100% green (passing CI and all reviews addressed) and hands off to Ron for manual merge.

## Workflow Execution Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Wait for Reviewers to Settle (Quiescence Window)
Query the check suites on the current PR head commit:
```bash
   bun .agents/skills/pr-review-remediation/scripts/pr_review_tools.js suites <commit_sha>
```
- If `allCompleted` is `false`, schedule a timer (45–60 seconds) and wait.
- Proceed only when all automated reviewers have posted their findings for the current commit.

### Phase 2: 360-Degree Batch Extraction
Fetch all review threads, summaries, outside-diff suggestions, and nitpicks across all surfaces:
```bash
   bun .agents/skills/pr-review-remediation/scripts/pr_review_tools.js fetch <pr_number>
```
Extract and categorize:
- **Pending Action Threads** (`pendingActionThreads`): Unresolved threads and threads where the latest comment is a reviewer follow-up/question.
- **Top-Level PR Reviews** (`reviews`): Formal review submissions and approval states.
- **Bot Issue Comments** (`botSummaries`): Overall review reports and outside-diff suggestions.
- **Collapsible Nitpicks**: Extracted `<details>` sections.

### Phase 3: Codebase Verification & Planning
1. Verify every finding against actual source code to filter out false positives or obsolete remarks.
2. Formulate a structured plan:
   - **Valid Fixes**: Rationale and proposed code changes.
   - **Technical Rebuttals**: Evidence-based explanations (referencing source code, framework invariants, or architectural constraints) for why a suggestion is not applicable or is a false positive.
3. Present the plan to the user for confirmation before editing code.

### Phase 4: Unified Implementation & Local Testing
1. Apply all accepted fixes across all relevant files.
2. Run local verification suites:
   ```bash
   # OnTheRoad repository-native quality gates
   bun run governance:check && bun test
   ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug --no-daemon
   ```
3. Ensure all tests pass and zero compiler/lint errors exist before proceeding.

### Phase 5: Single Local Commit; Approval Before External Writes
After local validation, stage and commit all changes in a single atomic commit only when local commit creation is authorized:
```bash
git add <modified_files>
git commit -m "fix: resolve PR #<num> review feedback across <components>"
```
Pushing to GitHub, posting replies, resolving threads, merging, or deploying is a separate approval gate and must not be inferred from local commit approval.

### Phase 6: Attributed Replies & Technical Rebuttals
1. Post replies to each comment thread using the helper tool (which automatically appends the `- AG-Ron` sign-off signature at the bottom):
   - For fixes: `"Verified and fixed: <explanation of change>"`
   - For technical rebuttals: `"Technical rebuttal: <evidence-backed explanation>"`
   ```bash
   bun .agents/skills/pr-review-remediation/scripts/pr_review_tools.js reply <pr_number> <comment_id> "<message>"
   ```
2. **DO NOT resolve review threads**: Leave review threads open so that the original reviewer (e.g. CodeRabbit bot or human reviewer) or Ron can inspect the changes, post follow-ups, and resolve the thread.

### Phase 7: Verification Loop & Final Handoff
1. Loop back to **Phase 1** to wait for the new commit's check-suites and bot reviews to settle.
2. If new comments arrive on the new commit, execute the next batched cycle (Phases 2–6).
3. Once all check-suites are `success` and all feedback is addressed:
   - Present a concise summary to the user.
   - Hand off to Ron for manual review and merge.
