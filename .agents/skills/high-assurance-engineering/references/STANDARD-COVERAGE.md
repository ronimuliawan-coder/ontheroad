# Declared Standard and Coverage Matrix

Use this document when auditing, extending, or versioning the high-assurance standard. It is
the canonical map of required controls; it is not loaded for ordinary engagements.

“100% covered” means every control declared below has an owning instruction, operator
explanation where needed, and evidence surface. It does not mean every future technology,
failure mode, or unknown risk has been predicted. When a real gap is found, add or revise a
control and update this matrix in the same change.

## Coverage states

- **Contract:** Binding behavior exists in `MASTER-PROMPT.md` or `SKILL.md`.
- **Guide:** Human/agent interpretation exists in `OPERATOR-GUIDE.md`.
- **Artifact:** An optional template makes the evidence reproducible.
- **Covered:** Contract exists and any necessary guide/artifact is linked.

## Maintaining full declared coverage

Before accepting a change to this standard:

1. Identify which control IDs it changes or adds.
2. Update the master contract first when behavior is binding.
3. Update operator explanation only when interpretation or execution needs detail.
4. Update or add an artifact only when it improves reproducibility.
5. Search for contradictory or obsolete text across all package files.
6. Validate every matrix row still has a real owner; never mark a row covered by aspiration.
7. Run the skill validator, portability scan, link/file checks, and a realistic dry-run of any
   changed router or decision table.
8. Record limitations honestly. Unknown future risks belong in ongoing review, not a false
   claim of universal perfection.
